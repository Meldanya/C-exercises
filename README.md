#About
These are my solutions for the exercises in the book [Writing efficient C code: a thorough introduction for Java developers](http://www.adlibris.com/se/product.aspx?isbn=9197794007) by Jonas Skeppstedt and Christian SÃ¶derberg.

I'm writing these as a part of the [C programming course](http://cs.lth.se/edaa25/) at Lund University.

Hopefully they can be of some use for other people, but do the exercises your self first! Otherwise, what's the point of trying to learn a new language if you just copy someone else?

All code in this git repository is yours under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Which basically means, it's public domain and you can do whatever you want with it.

#DISCLAIMER
I don't guarantee the correctness of any of the code (although I've tested it a bit) so don't use this as a reference on correct C code.

I'm also not affiliated with the authors in any way.
